# First_Lua_Project
This is my first Lua project and here I am creating a pong game using a very interesting framework, LÖVE (Love2d)

# What is LÖVE ?
I'm guessing you probably already know, but for those who don't, LÖVE is a 2D game engine (or, framework). It's an environment which contains a lot of pre-written code targeted at making games. It interfaces with the Lua programming language to makes things even easier for you.

Compared to other 2D engines, LÖVE is the best I've seen so far. Its API (Application Programming Interface) is very simple and (usually) intuitive, Lua is a great language, the environment in general is nice, and the community is very friendly and supportive. Oh yeah, it's totally free and open-source too, licensed under the very liberal zlib/libpng license.
